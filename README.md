# Ola-Taxi-Ride-Analysis
## Recommended Structure and Order
### 1. Ola Taxi Ride Performance & Business Insights Dashboard
Developed a complete analytics system to evaluate Ola ride performance using cleaned and modelled data. Focused on key business areas such as bookings, cancellations, revenue trends, customer ratings, and vehicle performance. Built multiple interactive dashboards that transform raw data into clear insights for decision-making. The project demonstrates strong data cleaning, SQL analysis, KPI creation, and advanced Power BI visualization skills.

### 2.  Purpose 
This project analyzes Ola ride operations by breaking down bookings, cancellations, revenue, and customer ratings across all vehicle types. It focuses on identifying usage trends, customer behaviour patterns, and driver-related performance insights. The dashboards highlight key metrics such as booking success rate, major cancellation reasons, payment method contribution, and distance travelled. SQL and Excel were used to clean, transform, and model the dataset before building the visuals. Power BI brings the data together through interactive charts, KPIs, and drill-down reports. The analysis helps compare performance across Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, Mini, Auto, Bike, and E-Bike categories. Overall, the project delivers a complete analytical view that supports operational improvement and strategic decision-making.
